# finite-state-machine-tools

Tool Suite (Java Implementation) for creating different type of Finite State Machines (DFA's, NFA's, Lambda/Epsilon NFA's), converting between them, and testing them with a specified input.

In the Pipeline:

-NFA's to DFA's

-Regular Expressions to Lambda/Epsilon NFA's

-JavaFX Visualization
